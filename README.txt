Release notes:

	This is a very simple UI, nothing fancy i would say, except for a pair of modifications.

	My goal is to preserve the original look and feel and get rid of the things that annoy me the most,
	like filigrees, rounded corners and those big and intrusive titlebars that are everywhere
	wasting precious space.

	Now i think the windows are much easier to organize in screen, in most cases they are smaller and clearer.
	Some other windows are reworked too, hope you like the modifications.

	Please, be aware VoktarUI is designed to use the SegoeUI font, the same one used by default in modern
	Windows operating systems.

	Other fonts like the one EverQuest uses by default have a different letter spacing, so keep it in mind.

	These are some batch files you can use to further customize the look of the interface:

	. Spells_Icons_Classic.bat: Install classic spells icons.
	. Spells_Icons_Current.bat (default): Use current spells icons instead.

	. Windows_Transparent.bat (default): Use some transparent windows.
	. Windows_Textured.bat: Use textured windows.

	. Copy_Layout_1920x1080.bat: Install the 1080p windows layout.
	. Copy_Layout_2560x1440.bat: Install the 1440p windows layout.

				     For vertical hotbars to look the same as the screenshots you have to manually
				     change their button size to 91%.
